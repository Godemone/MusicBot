My Music Bot Code

This code lists all the mp3 files in the given path with numbers and prints it with as format print(f"{# assigned} file name")

Then asks user for an input value. 

If the value is in the interval of [1 , # of files]:
  it plays the mp3 file assigned to that number
else:
  it prints an error message

Function: Random Play
  If user enters 4444 for the input value, it selects and plays a random mp3 file from the given path.

Important note: Don't forget to install libraries used in the code by typing "pip3 install <library_name>" to the terminal (PowerShell).
